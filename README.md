### RBGParser v1.1

This version improves parsing speed using the hash kernel (see [4]) and by optimizing the code. We also improved the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) slightly and labeled attachment score (LAS) significantly.

#### About and Contact

This project is developed at Natural Language Processing group in MIT. It contains a Java implementation of a syntactic dependency parser with tensor decomposition and greedy decoding, described in [1,2,3].

This project is implemented by Tao Lei (taolei [at] csail.mit.edu) and Yuan Zhang (yuanzh [at] csail.mit.edu).

Alberta huddled in the corner of the nest she shared with her mother
She was alone in the nest because her parents were teaching their children how to fly.
"Come on scaredy-cat!" yelled a brother as he swooped by the nest showing off.
Sparrows, like Alberta and her family, do not have colorful feathers,but they are good fliers.
All except Alberta. A tear dripped off Alberta's beak.
She wanted to learn to fly, too, but every time she went to the edge of the nest and looked over the side, she felt dizzy.
It was up so high!
Alberta's parents had built their nest in a plant that hung high in the air on the porch of a house where people live.
Maybe like your house.
Alberta's dad landed near her
Ready to give those wings a try?
I guess so.
Alberta stretched her wings and shook them out
You'll be beside me?
Alberta took a deep breath, closed her little black eyes and leaped off the side of the nest into the air.
Flap those wings!
shouted her dad
in no time she felt a breeze.
She opened her eyes.
She saw her father and mother with eyes
They fly beside her
her brothers and sisters flying above her
But when she looked down, she saw the most amazing sight!
Alberta was flying so high, that the nest was below her!
The whole Sparrow family cheered for Alberta
